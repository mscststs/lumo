# Lumo

AI-powered browser sidebar assistant — a Chrome extension that brings a full-featured AI agent directly into your browser.

Lumo connects to third-party LLM APIs and provides deep browser integration through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling the AI to interact with tabs, pages, network, DevTools, and more.

## Installation

### Chrome Web Store (stable)

**[Install Lumo from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lumo/cgfnadidpooocnkalljpdmelmaponefa)**

This is the easiest way to install and it auto-updates. Note that **the Chrome Web Store version lags behind the code in this repository** — each release has to pass Google's review, so recently merged features and fixes are usually not in it yet.

### Latest build from GitHub Actions (up to date)

Every push to `main` is built by the [Build & Upload Extension](../../actions/workflows/build.yml) workflow, which publishes the packed extension as an artifact:

1. Open the [latest successful workflow run](../../actions/workflows/build.yml?query=is%3Asuccess).
2. Download the `lumo-chrome-mv3` artifact from the run's **Artifacts** section (requires being signed in to GitHub).
3. Unzip it — GitHub wraps artifacts in a zip, and inside you get the unpacked extension directory.
4. Go to `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked**, and select the unzipped directory.

Caveats of this route: it does **not** auto-update (repeat the steps to upgrade), Chrome will show a "disable developer mode extensions" warning on startup, artifacts expire after GitHub's retention period, and it installs as a separate extension from the Web Store version. Builds from `main` are unreleased code and may be unstable.

You can also [build from source](#getting-started) yourself.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Development
