 * trails the repository by however long review takes, while a build loaded from
 * a GitHub Actions artifact is current but never updates itself — and both can
 * be installed at once, as separate extensions. Naming the channel turns "which
 * one am I looking at" from guesswork into a glance, and the extension id
 * underneath is what makes a bug report unambiguous.
