/**
 * Which build of Lumo is running, and where it came from.
 *
 * The Web Store version deliberately lags the repository — every release has to
 * pass Google's review — and the GitHub Actions artifact installs as a *separate*
 * extension, so a user can easily be running both at once. Nothing in the UI used
 * to say which one a given window belonged to, which made version-specific bug
 * reports guesswork.
 *
 * The channel is derived from the extension id: an id is assigned by the Web
 * Store at publish time and cannot be forged by a local build, so the published
 * id is the one reliable discriminator available at runtime. Everything else —
 * the Actions artifact, `load unpacked`, `wxt dev` — gets a key generated from
 * the unpacked directory, so it is "github" by elimination.
