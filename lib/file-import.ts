/**
 * What a file dragged in from the operating system is allowed to become.
 *
 * Two surfaces accept such a drop — the side panel (`ChatPanel`) and the options
 * page file manager — and they must agree on the answer, so the decision lives
 * here rather than in either of them.
 *
 * ## Only text and images
 *
 * A stored file exists to be read: by the model through `file_read`, and by the
 * user through the preview tab. Neither can do anything with a `.zip` or an
 * `.exe`, so those are refused rather than parked in IndexedDB forever. Images
 * are usable, but only inline in a conversation where a vision model can see
 * them — they are never written to storage, which keeps the file manager free of
 * binary blobs.
 *
 * The three-way split is `getPreviewCategory`'s, not a second whitelist: that
 * function already decides what the preview tab can render, and "renderable as
 * text" is exactly "worth storing". Adding a parallel list here would let the two
 * drift, and a file that stored fine but could not be previewed is precisely the
 * confusing case.
 *
 * ## Failures are silent
 *
 * A refused file simply does not appear. There is no message, because the only
 * honest one would restate what the user can already see, and a drop that lands
 * outside the accepted set is a mis-drag, not an error worth interrupting for.
