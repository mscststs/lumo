/**
 * Slash commands — the `/` vocabulary of the chat composer.
 *
 * A command is a *typing shortcut*, not a message: it is recognised in the
 * composer, resolved at send time, and then either expands into text or runs a
 * panel action. Two kinds exist and they are deliberately different in kind:
 *
 * - **Built-in** commands (`/new`, `/exit`) name an action the UI can perform.
 *   They ship with the extension, so their names and behaviour are code, not
 *   data — only whether they are enabled is the user's to store.
 * - **User** commands are phrases. `/fy` → "translate this page" is nothing more
 *   than a text substitution the composer performs on the way out, which is why
 *   they need no runtime hook of any kind.
 *
 * ## Why names are unique only among *enabled* commands
 *
 * A disabled command is inert: it never appears in the picker and never resolves,
 * so two disabled `/fy` entries cannot confuse anything. Enforcing global
 * uniqueness would instead force the user to rename or delete an entry they are
 * merely parking, and would make importing a config fail on a collision with
 * something switched off. So the invariant is narrower and enforced on *write*:
 * enabling a name disables every other holder of it (see `withCommandEnabled`
 * and `upsertUserCommand`). `resolveEnabledCommands` still de-duplicates on read,
 * because a hand-edited or older config can violate the invariant and the picker
 * must never show the same trigger twice.
 *
 * This module is deliberately data-only — no React, no `chrome.*` — so the
 * options page, the composer and the tests all agree on one set of rules.
