 * How hard a reasoning model should think before it answers.
 *
 * The offered levels follow the *provider*, not this app: each provider defines
 * its own set, so what a model may be set to depends on which provider it hangs
 * off (see {@link REASONING_EFFORTS_BY_PROVIDER}). Where a provider publishes no
 * enum at all — the OpenAI Responses API takes `reasoning_effort` as a free
 * string — we supply the widest set its family is known to accept.
 *
 * Two levels are ours rather than any provider's:
 * - `'provider-default'` is the identity value: the field is omitted entirely, so
 *   the request is byte-for-byte what it was before this setting existed. That
 *   matters more than a tidier default, because `@ai-sdk/openai` writes
 *   `reasoning_effort` into the Chat Completions body *unconditionally* — it does
 *   not drop it for a model it fails to recognise as a reasoning model. A
 *   third-party "OpenAI compatible" gateway that has never heard of the field
 *   will therefore see it and may reject the request, so no model may acquire a
 *   level it was not explicitly given.
 * - `'none'` on Anthropic is not an `effort` value but a different field
 *   (`thinking: { type: 'disabled' }`). It is offered because turning thinking
 *   off is a real Anthropic capability, and the SDK already maps it there.
