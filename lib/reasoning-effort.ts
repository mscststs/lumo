/**
 * How hard a reasoning model should think before it answers.
 *
 * The offered levels follow the *provider*, not this app: each provider defines
 * its own set, so what a model may be set to depends on which provider it hangs
 * off (see {@link REASONING_EFFORTS_BY_PROVIDER}). Where a provider publishes no
 * enum at all — the OpenAI Responses API takes `reasoning_effort` as a free
 * string — we supply the widest set its family is known to accept.
 *
 * Every level is a value of the AI SDK's unified `reasoning` setting, so every
 * level rides that setting and the SDK's provider adapter translates it per
 * model. Only two spellings are ours:
 * - `'provider-default'` is the identity value: the field is omitted entirely, so
 *   the request is byte-for-byte what it was before this setting existed. That
 *   matters more than a tidier default, because `@ai-sdk/openai` writes
 *   `reasoning_effort` into the Chat Completions body *unconditionally* — it does
 *   not drop it for a model it fails to recognise as a reasoning model. A
 *   third-party "OpenAI compatible" gateway that has never heard of the field
 *   will therefore see it and may reject the request, so no model may acquire a
 *   level it was not explicitly given.
 * - `'none'` on Anthropic is not an `effort` value but a different field
 *   (`thinking: { type: 'disabled' }`). It is offered because turning thinking
 *   off is a real Anthropic capability, and the SDK already maps it there.

 * Levels offered per provider type, in display order.

 *   `low | medium | high | xhigh | max`; `'none'` is added for the separate
 *   thinking-disabled switch. There is no `minimal`, so it is not offered.
 * - `openai-chat` — verbatim the `reasoningEffort` enum of
 *   `@ai-sdk/openai`'s Chat model.
 * - `openai-responses` — the Responses schema types this field as a free string,
 *   i.e. publishes no enum, so this is the broadest set the OpenAI family is
 *   known to take. A model that rejects one fails the request, which is why the
 *   default remains "send nothing".
 * - `google` — Gemini publishes both a `thinkingLevel` enum (`low | medium |
 *   high`, plus `minimal` on models whose minimum allows it) on gemini-3-and
 *   later and a token `thinkingBudget` on gemini-2.5-and-earlier, where the SDK
 *   scales the budget off the same level (2 % … 100 % of the thinking budget).
 *   Every level below therefore has a spelling on at least one Gemini family;
 *   a level a particular model cannot express is degraded to the nearest one it
 *   can (with an SDK warning) rather than failing the request. `'none'` means a
 *   zero budget on the models that allow one, and the lowest level elsewhere.
