/**
 * Typed, fire-and-forget event bus across the extension's trusted contexts.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Several things the UI must react to live in IndexedDB (stored files,
 * conversations), which emits no cross-context change event. Until now each case
 * was solved ad hoc and differently: a bounded revision counter in
 * `chrome.storage.local` for conversations, and a 3-second `setInterval` poll in
 * `ConversationFiles` for files. Raw `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` was the obvious
 * alternative but is awkward to use directly, because every notification needs a
 * hand-written sender *and* a matching listener that has to re-check the message
 * shape, and nothing ties the two together — a typo in either half fails silently.
 *
 * This module makes the pair a single typed declaration: add a key to
 * `LumoEventMap`, then `emitEvent` and `onEvent` are checked against it. There is
 * no registration step and no init call; the underlying `chrome.runtime.onMessage`
 * listener is installed on the first subscription and removed after the last.
 *
 * ## The one behaviour worth knowing
 *
 * `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` delivers `onMessage` to every page in the
 * extension *except the frame that sent it*. A file written by an MCP tool runs
 * in the side panel, and `ConversationFiles` — which needs to know — lives in
 * that same side panel, so a pure `sendMessage` bus would notify every context
 * except the one where the change originated. `emitEvent` therefore dispatches to
 * local subscribers directly as well as broadcasting. Local delivery is
 * synchronous and remote delivery is not, which is fine for the only contract
 * offered here: "something changed, re-read it".
 *
 * ## Scope and guarantees
 *
 * - Reaches the background worker and every extension page (side panel, options,
 *   preview). It does *not* reach content scripts — `runtime.sendMessage` cannot
 *   target them; use `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` for that.
 * - Delivery is best-effort and unacknowledged. A context that is not listening
 *   at emit time misses the event, so this is for *notifications*, never for
 *   state. Anything a context must know when it starts up belongs in storage,
 *   which is why `conversationsRevision` and `mcpSettings` stay on
 *   `chrome.storage.onChanged`: those readers need the value on mount too.
 * - Payloads cross a structured clone, so they must be plain data.
 * - Events are never coalesced. Merging them would mean dropping payload fields —
 *   two writes to different files would collapse into one, and a subscriber
 *   filtering on file name would miss its own. Subscribers that want to throttle
 *   should throttle their own reload.
