/**
 * External MCP Server implementation using @ai-sdk/mcp.
 * Supports both HTTP Streamable and SSE transport types.
 *
 * State model:
 * - `enabled` (from config): user intent, toggled instantly
 * - `status`: runtime connection state (disconnected → connecting → connected | unauthorized | error)
 *
 * Protocol eras: since `2026-07-28` MCP has no `initialize` handshake, and the
 * SDK probes with `server/discover` first. Legacy servers reject that probe, and
 * the SDK falls back on its own — but the rejection also reaches us through
 * `transport.onerror`. Treating it as a server failure is what painted an error
 * card on servers that had in fact connected, so the era is now resolved up
 * front (and cached per origin) instead: see `protocol-era.ts`.
 *
 * Authorization: servers that answer `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge
 * are OAuth protected resources (MCP authorization spec). Connecting never runs
 * that flow — it sends the stored token, refreshes once when the token is stale
 * or rejected, and otherwise ends in `unauthorized` until the user signs in.
 * Discovery, dynamic registration and the consent window belong to the explicit
 * `authorize()` path only (see `oauth/token-source.ts`).
 *
 * A manual `Authorization` header wins over OAuth: it is static credentials the
 * user pasted, and letting discovery replace them would silently discard the
 * token that already works.
